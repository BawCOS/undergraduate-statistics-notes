# Notes for Teaching an Undergraduate Statistics Using fastR

Bradley Warner

This repository holds the R Markdown source for the book "Notes for Teaching an Undergraduate Statistics Using fastR" to be published online. A rendered version of the completed book chapters is ...

The book is designed to be a guide and set of notes for both the instructor and students to teach a mathematical and R based probability and statistics course.  It is designed to be used with the book Foundations and Applications of Statistics: An Introduction Using R by Randall Pruim. With a little more effort, they could be used as standalone notes for a course.  I have passed these notes out to students to supplement their reading but find that many use them as their sole learning resoure. I have used and refined these notes for four semesters.  .
